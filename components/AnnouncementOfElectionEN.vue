  <h3>Voting system</h3>

  <p> The Fachschaft forms a constituency. Everybody who is eligible to vote can vote for one candidate.</p>

  <p> The people with the most votes and at least one vote are elected.</p>

  <p> If two candidates got the same amount of votes the election supervisor will decide the order by lot.</p>

  <p> If an elected person resigns the seat will be fill with the person that got the most votes and at least one
    and is not a member of the representatives yet. If every elected person is a member of the representatives the
    seat will not be filled again.</p>

  <p> If at one point more than half of the seats are unoccupied new elections will be held as soon as possible.
    The chairperson of the FSR immediately summons a meeting of the FSVV which decides on a new date and a new
    election committee. </p>
